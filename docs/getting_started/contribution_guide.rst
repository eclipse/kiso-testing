Contribution Guide
==================

What should I do before I get started?
--------------------------------------

You need to go through few steps to get the ball rolling. But no worries,
it is pretty straightforward.

Accounts
--------

First of all, you need accounts for:

  - Github account, some of you might already have one.
    If not, you can go to github and register a free user account in 2 minutes.

.. note::
  If you are working for a company and the work you are going to contribute
  is in the name of the company, please register your account using company
  email address.

  - Eclipse account, since Kiso-testing is an Eclipse project
  (full name: Eclipse Kiso-testing),   you need an Eclipse account.
  Go to https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register to register one for free.

After a successful registration, you need to hook up your github account with
Eclipse account. Login in Eclipse foundation website and go to ‘Edit My Profile’
where you can bind your github account information.

ECA signing
-----------

ECA stands for ‘Eclipse Contributor Agreement’, which is a prerequisite to
become a contributor. No paper work needed, go to
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php , read it carefully and follow its
instruction to sign.

DCO signing
-----------

DCO stand for "Developer's Certificate of Origin", which you will encounter as
part of ECA signing process. It is highly recommended that you read it, while
you as a developer might overlook the legal consequences if the way you
contribute does not follow certain rules and regulations.

or develop an open source project. Eclipse Kiso is and will be developed under
the EPL v2.0 license from Eclipse foundation.
